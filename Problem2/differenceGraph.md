In order to show concensus number, a tooltip is the best way so they can see the average value while hovering over any point. 

I also like having tabular representation so including a table with the actual numbers and percentage from average while hovering is my preferredway of showing difference. 

In the group design studio we discussed several ideas around using tooltip with bars etc.
